Open Source Medical Software (OSMS) provides equal technological access to people who are typically considered to be at a socioeconomic disadvantage. We are dedicated to providing free, high-quality medical software to rural health centers, county health departments, urban clinics and other medical practices that are committed to treating the disadvantaged. We aim to develop and distribute software that is equal in quality to proprietary software used by more prosperous, private clinics and we go a step further by delivering free technological assistance, support and documentation to the clinics we serve.  <br><br>
