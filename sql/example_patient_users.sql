# fmg: the example patients' data (example_patient_data.sql) references providers
# not created by defaults.sql so that some functions cause odd matches in the
# program. For example, adding a visit for such a patient shows that visit as
# applicable to several providers (with id's such as "a a", "1 1", etc.).
#
# This inserts (iff don't already exist) the referenced users
