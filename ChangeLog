2008-02-04 Changes made to OpenEMR by CHEMED
1. Each user is associated with one facility (Default Facility) in the interface
2. Calendar will not be able to schedule appointments in a facility other than default for the user.
3. When clicking on the time slot to make an appointment the popup form is populated with relevant user and his facility.
   These fields are made read only.
4. When scheduling a new appointment using "Add" button the user and facility fields are editable.
5. The Calendar is redesigned.
   a) All the columns are of equial width.
   b) Calendar view resizes itself on the browser window resize
   c) Events are presented as colored chips overlaying the calendar, so the length of event is apparent.
   d) IN/OUT/LUNCH etc. events are visually different from others (do not look like chips).
   e) View (day/week/year) is selected by buttons.
   f) When mousing over an icon to the left of jumpdate field user is presented with a popup overlay that
      allows him to select a date from a calendar or some users from a list or a facility.
   g) Facility change is immediate (no need to click on "Go" button).
   h) To dismiss this popup user have to mouse over the icon again.
   i) When printing the calendar old template wil be used, because of the problem in Firefox, which only
      prints a first page of absolutely positioned DOM elements. New interface printing does work in IE.
   j) The column headers stay in place and only the events list scrolls down.
   k) Appointment Status symbol is shown in a top-right corner of event chip.
6. When selecting a patient for an appointment it is possible to search by whole or part of a phone number.
7. Bug: Calendar showed '12pm' as '12am'
8. Bug: The time on the event chip was in 24 hours format, changed to am/pm format.
9. Calendar UI choice is now a per-user option (new field added to users table).
