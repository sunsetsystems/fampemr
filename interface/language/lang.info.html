I. Multi Language Tool.

  This is the Language Administration page in OpenEMR. This is where you can
customize languages and language definitions. You can add new languages,
,add new English Constants, and modify/add language definitions. (Please note
you can also enter your translations into the official OpenEMR Language
Translation GoogleDoc spreadsheet; see section II. for details)

  The following is an explanation of the options in this tool:
    Add Language: You get a box to enter a new language.
    Add Constant: You get a box to add a new string to be used in the translation
                  function, this one should be used only if you know what you are
                  doing, mostly, if you added some custom programming with new
                  text output. The "constant" string can be literally what you
                  want to say or a shorter reference to it.
    Edit Definitions: English is used as the reference language, if you click
                      the English label you'll get a set of all constants and
                      the English definitions at the side. If no definition is
                      loaded yet for a given constant then a blank box is shown,
                      by entering a definition and clicking "Load Definition" 
                      you save whatever changes you made. If you click other
                      label than English, you get a set of all constants,
                      the English definition at the side, and an input box
                      to enter/modify the definition in the selected language.


II. Official OpenEMR Language Translations

  The OpenEMR language translations are built from a collaborative Google
Doc. If you would like to add a language or help with a current language,
please contact us.  You could then enter your translations into this
spreadsheet, which will then become a permanent part of OpenEMR. This
process has become very streamlined with a fast turnaround time, so
we would suggest you enter data on this collaborative spreadsheet rather
than entering into your local OpenEMR installation only. To download the
most uptodate set of translations, visit our wiki at oemr.org.


III. Language Translations Setting

  These are configured in the openemr/interface/globals.php
file. Mainly, you can configure the default language and
what is displayed in the login language selection menu (you
can also disable this menu). There are also more advanced
setting to turn off certain parts of the translation
engine. Please see the Language section of
openemr/interface/globals.php for more details.


IV. Developer Instructions

The translation is done by the xl() custom function, which can be found
at openemr/library/translation.inc.php.
Its semantics are very simple.

xl (string,'r',string-prepend,string-append)

Which with examples means:

xl ('translate this')

By default the function will return (after all, is a function) the translation.

First it uses the LANGUAGE constant defined to pick the translation.

Second it goes for the translation, if none is found, then the same string entered is used and returned as is.

The first optional and only argument is 'e' which stands for echo. Use it if you want the function to echo the translated result instead of returning it.

i.e.
xl ('translate this','e')

But if you are already within another function, then you want the function to return something.

i.e.
echo ("this and" . xl('translate this') . "that too");

The third and fourth optional arguments are strings to be prepend and appended respectively.

i.e.
xl ('translate this','e','&#60b>','&#60/b>');

will echo
&#60b>this translated&#60/b>

If you want only something to be appended in the a return, then you must supply empty second and third arguments.

i.e.
xl ('translate this','','','&#60br>');
will echo
this translated&#60br>

There are also wrappers to the xl() function that are used infrequently in specific situations. Please
refer to openemr/library/translation.inc.php for more details.
